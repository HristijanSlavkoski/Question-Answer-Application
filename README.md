# Question-Answer-Application
This is Question &amp; Answer Application in Spring Boot using MVC Pattern.
This was created during the winter internship program at Armedia 2022.

For using this application you need to set sql base. In <br>
<strong>/project/First-Project/src/main/resources/application.properties</strong> <br>
you need to set user and password for your local sql server.

On startup there are no users created, so you need to create them manually.
